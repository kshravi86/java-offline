# java offline

This is a basic SwiftUI application structure created manually.

**IMPORTANT:**
The `java_offline.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file is a complex, machine-generated file that is essential for building the project. The file currently in place is a minimal placeholder and will likely cause the GitHub Actions workflow to fail.

To make this project buildable, you must:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Create a new iOS App project with the name "java offline" and the bundle ID "com.java.offline".
3. Replace the generated Swift files with the `java_offlineApp.swift` and `ContentView.swift` provided here.
4. Commit the entire generated `.xcodeproj` directory.
